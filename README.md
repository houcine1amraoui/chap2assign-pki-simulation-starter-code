# Lab 2: PKI Simulation Assignment

This repository contains a basic boilerplate code for you to get started with and solve the assignment. 

## Description

In task 4, we have discussed the need of a third party trusted by both the client and the server that responsible for signing and issues certificates. In this assignment, you are asked to implement a simulation to what happens inside a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In other words, create three Express API servers Client, Server, and CA each running on a specific port and implement all the interactions that happens between them as depicted in the following sequence diagram.
